# Personal Portfolio with .NET Core

> WIP WIP: this is the source code of my website. It has blog, email management system, and authentication system. The auth system enables me to view sent emails via the contact me form, show notifications if the email is not read, and let me do CRUD operations on the blog posts.

---

## Deployment
- Via `Docker`. To deploy the website you must dockerize the project and include .NET core and node packages in it.
- Once dockerized you can then deploy it using heroku or similar web services sites. ðŸ˜‡
